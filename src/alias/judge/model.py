"""Shared model factory for the judge layer.

Returns the right pydantic-ai model object depending on settings:

- ALIAS_JUDGE_BASE_URL unset → pass judge_model string directly to Agent;
  pydantic-ai resolves the provider prefix (e.g. 'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6').

- ALIAS_JUDGE_BASE_URL set → construct an OpenAIChatModel pointed at a custom
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. Databricks Serving Endpoints, Azure AI,
  Ollama). ALIAS_JUDGE_MODEL becomes the deployment/model name on that endpoint
  and ALIAS_JUDGE_API_KEY is the bearer token (e.g. a Databricks PAT).
